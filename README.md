# Movie Recommender System

This is a Movie Recommender System built using machine learning and Streamlit. The system recommends movies based on the user's selected movie. The system fetches movie posters using The Movie Database (TMDb) API.

### Prerequisites

* Python 3.x
* pip (Python package installer)

### Steps to Set Up and Run the Project

#### 1. **Clone the Repository**

First, clone this repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/movie-recommender.git
cd movie-recommender
```

#### 2. **Create a Virtual Environment**

It is recommended to create a virtual environment to manage dependencies. You can create one using the following command:

```bash
python3 -m venv movie_recommender_env
```

#### 3. **Activate the Virtual Environment**

* On **macOS/Linux**, run:

  ```bash
  source movie_recommender_env/bin/activate
  ```

* On **Windows**, run:

  ```bash
  .\movie_recommender_env\Scripts\activate
  ```

#### 4. **Install Dependencies**

Install all the required dependencies using the following command:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Alternatively, you can install the necessary dependencies individually:

```bash
pip install streamlit requests pandas python-dotenv
```

#### 5. **Get Your API Key**

1. Go to [The Movie Database (TMDb) website](https://www.themoviedb.org/).
2. Create an account or log in.
3. Go to [API section](https://www.themoviedb.org/settings/api) and create a new API key.
4. Copy your API key for use in the project.

#### 6. **Set Up the API Key**

1. Create a `.env` file in the root directory of the project (same directory as `app.py`).
2. Add your API key to the `.env` file as follows:

   **.env:**

   ```
   TMDB_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
   ```

   Replace `your_api_key_here` with the API key you obtained from TMDb.

#### 7. **Run the Jupyter Notebook**

Before running the Streamlit app, you need to run the `movie_recommender.ipynb` notebook to generate the necessary data files (`similarity.pkl` and `movies.pkl`).

To do this, run the following command:

```bash
jupyter notebook movie_recommender.ipynb
```

Follow the instructions in the notebook to execute all the cells.

#### 8. **Run the Streamlit App**

Once you have generated the necessary files from the notebook, you can start the Streamlit app by running the following command in your terminal:

```bash
streamlit run app.py
```

This will launch the Movie Recommender System in your browser.

### Folder Structure

```
movie-recommender/
├── app.py               # Streamlit app to display the movie recommendations
├── movie_recommender.ipynb  # Jupyter notebook to generate recommendation data
├── .env                 # Store TMDB API key
├── requirements.txt     # List of project dependencies
├── similarity.pkl       # Precomputed similarity data (generated by notebook)
└── movies.pkl           # Movies data (generated by notebook)
```

### Additional Notes

* Ensure that you do not push the `.env` file to any public repositories, as it contains sensitive information (your API key). You should add `.env` to your `.gitignore` file.
* If you encounter issues with the API key, check that it is correctly stored in the `.env` file and that it's being loaded properly by the code.
